# SixPackGenerator
Just a simple exercise app for building Six Packs!!!

I've started using flutter as my build engine for creating mobile applications.
YES, it's simple. But, what do you expect from a beginner? 
Do you think I can straight-away create something like Google and so on?
Anyway, this is my small [but actually the biggest so far :) ] 
I created using VSCODE and Flutter.
All the picture is also from Google Images.
